### Employee Demographics
#### 1. What is the total number of employees in the company?
````sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalNumberEmployee
FROM HumanResources.Employee;
````
#### Steps:
Use **COUNT** to count all the rows in the ```Employee``` table 

#### Answer:
![Question1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119062221/211762317-1e84e0e6-55db-4782-a0cc-86fa087c0778.png)

#### 2. What is the number of employees by department?
````sql
SELECT d.[Name] AS Department, 
		COUNT(*) AS TotalNumberEmployee, 
		ROUND ((COUNT(*) * 100.00 /(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HumanResources.Employee)), 2) AS 'Percentage'
FROM HumanResources.Employee e
INNER JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory edh
ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Department d
ON edh.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.[Name];
````
#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to find out ```TotalNumberEmployee``` by each department.
- Use **JOIN** to merge ```EmployeeDepartmentHistory```, ```Employee``` and ```Department``` tables as the first one is linking the two tables.

#### Answer:
![Question2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119062221/211766501-a3f78be5-6c50-46c9-93b5-f62444e2dc49.png)

INNER JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress bea
ON c.AddressID = bea.AddressID
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Employee e
ON bea.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID
GROUP BY c.Country;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a temp table ```cte_country``` to find employees country as this is not found in ```Address``` table rather in ```CountryRegion``` table through ```StateProvince``` table.
- Use **JOIN** to merge ```cte_country```, ```BusinessEntityAddress``` and ```Employee``` tables as employee addresses are in the ```BusinessEntityAddress``` table.
