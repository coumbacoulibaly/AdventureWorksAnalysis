#### 2. What is the number of employees by department?
````sql
SELECT d.[Name] AS Department, 
		COUNT(*) AS TotalNumberEmployee, 
		ROUND ((COUNT(*) * 100.00 /(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HumanResources.Employee)), 2) AS 'Percentage'
FROM HumanResources.Employee e
INNER JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory edh
ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Department d
ON edh.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.[Name];
````
#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to find out ```TotalNumberEmployee``` by each department.
