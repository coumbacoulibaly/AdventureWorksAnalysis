## Business Task
The production control team at AWC wish to to analyze their manufacturing processes. For this goal, they want to use data to monitor the factory work capacity and improve performance and yield. View here the case study and here my solution.

1. How much time it takes for the factory to manufacture a product in average? let also see it throught out the years?
2. How many orders has passed the inspection this year (2014) without any scraped items?
3. How product was scraped this year? find the scrape rate (percentage of production that is discarded as waste)
4. What was the most frequent scrap reason?
5. What is the lead time (time it takes to complete a manufacturing process from the start of production to the delivery of the finished product)?
6. What is the Yield of the factory (the proportion of good units produced out of total units started)?
7. What is the inventory turnover rate (the rate at which a company's inventory is sold and replaced)?
