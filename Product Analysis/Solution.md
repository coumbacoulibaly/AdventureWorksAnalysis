### 1. How many product do we manufacture?
````sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalNumberProduct
FROM Production.Product;
````
#### Steps:
Use **COUNT** to count all the rows in the ```Product``` table 

#### Answer:

### 2. How many product do we have by category? by sub-category?
````sql
-- By Subcategory
SELECT ps.[Name] AS Subcategory, COUNT(*) AS TotalNumberProduct 
FROM Production.Product p
FULL JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory ps 
ON ps.ProductSubcategoryID = p.ProductSubcategoryID
GROUP BY ps.[Name];

-- By Category
SELECT pc.[Name] AS Category, ps.[Name] AS Subcategory, COUNT(p.ProductID) AS TotalNumberProduct 
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory ps
FULL JOIN  Production.Product p
ON ps.ProductSubcategoryID = p.ProductSubcategoryID
FULL JOIN Production.ProductCategory pc
ON pc.ProductCategoryID = ps.ProductCategoryID
GROUP BY pc.[Name], ps.[Name]
ORDER BY pc.[Name];

````
#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to find out ```TotalNumberProduct``` by each Subcategory and Category.
- To calculate ```TotalNumberProduct``` by each Category, use **JOIN** to merge ```ProductSubcategory```, ```Product``` and ```ProductCategory``` tables as the first one is linking the two tables.
