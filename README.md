# :bicyclist: Adventure Works Cycles 
The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008. The database supports a fictitious company called Adventure Works Cycles. 

Adventure Works Cycles is a large, multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. The headquarters for Adventure Works Cycles is Bothell, Washington, where the company employs 500 workers. Additionally, Adventure Works Cycles employs several regional sales teams throughout its market base.

I utilized this sample database to sharpen my SQL skill and broaden my understanding of business-related data analytics applications.
