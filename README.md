# :bicyclist: Adventure Works Cycles 
The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008. The database supports a fictitious company called Adventure Works Cycles. 

Adventure Works Cycles is a large, multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. The headquarters for Adventure Works Cycles is Bothell, Washington, where the company employs 500 workers. Additionally, Adventure Works Cycles employs several regional sales teams throughout its market base.

I utilized this sample database to sharpen my SQL skill and broaden my understanding of business-related data analytics applications.

## Database Overview
This database contains 72 tables which are divided into 5 schemas
- **dbo** : have 3 tables they contain general informations about the database
- **Person** : 13 tables which contains all informations related to recorded in the database like employee, customers, vendors, etc.
- **Human Resources** : 6 tables focused on employee and the company administrations informations.
- **Production** : the largest schema with 25 tables mainly on the product and manufacturing informations. furthermore in the analysis, Ihave divided this schema into 3 subschema â€“ product, manufactring and inventory. This help understand easily the processes in this section.
- **Purschasing** : 5 tables with informations on the different supplyers which are called here vendors.
- **Sales** : 19 tables which contains informations on customers, store, salespeople, etc.

### 1. Business Entity
This table have a big role for the whole organization of the database. Despite the fact that it is part of the Person schema, it is primary key is present in almost all schemas. This is because it represent core elements of the business. A business entity is anything or anyone who interacts with the business like stores, customers, supplyers, employee, etc. After some reverse engineering, I came to the conclusion with these findings:
The _BusinessEntity_ table is directly link to _Person_, _Store_ and _Vendors_ on a one-to-one relationship. _Person_ is further related, also in a one-to-one fashion, to _Employee_, which is further related one-to-one with _SalesPerson_. For all of these tables, the primary key is the same, called _BusinessEntityID_. It's a hierarchal organization that help you understand supertype-subtype relationships.
